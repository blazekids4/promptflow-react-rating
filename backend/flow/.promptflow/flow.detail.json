        "reply": "Age discrimination is a significant concern in the workplace, and it's crucial for employers to understand the legal protections in place to prevent such discrimination. In the United States, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older [doc0]. This means that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants based on their age in hiring, firing, promotions, or any other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees, including state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and the federal government. It is important for employers to be aware of the specific provisions of the ADEA to ensure compliance with the law [doc1]. Additionally, it's essential for employers to create a work environment that promotes inclusivity and prevents age discrimination through policies, training, and a clear grievance procedure for addressing any complaints related to age discrimination.\n\nEmployers should also be mindful of the need for effective communication with individuals of all ages, as outlined in the ADEA and related regulations. This includes providing clear information about employment opportunities, benefits, and other relevant aspects of the workplace in a manner that is accessible to all employees, regardless of age [doc1].\n\nIn summary, the ADEA provides important legal protections against age discrimination in the workplace, and employers must proactively ensure compliance with its provisions to foster a fair and inclusive work environment [doc0].",

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id. Whether a par-\\nticular requirement is \\u2018\\u2018essential\\u2019\\u2019 will, of \\ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \\ncase. \\n\\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \\nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \\nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \\nFor example, the public entity must comply \\nwith this requirement when establishing \\nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio. In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160. The preamble to that section \\ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\\ndures \\n\\nConsistent with \\u00a7 35.105, self-evaluation, \\nthe final rule requires that public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504. In addition, \\u00a7 35.130 \\nincludes a number of provisions derived from \\ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\\ntions implementing section 504\"}}]}",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

                  "content": "Methods of providing \nthis information include, for example, the \npublication of information in handbooks, \nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \nto the public to describe a public entity’s \nprograms and activities; the display of in-\nformative posters in service centers and \nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\nmation by television or radio. In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160. The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

One commenter stated that, in order \nfor attorneys with disabilities to perform their \nprofessional duties to their clients and the court, it \nis essential that accessible courtrooms, conference \nrooms, law libraries, judicial chambers, and other \nareas of a courthouse be made barrier-free by \ntaking accessible design into account prior to \nconstruction. \n\nNumerous commenters identified a variety of \nbenefits that would accrue as a result of requiring \njudicial facilities to be accessible. These included \nthe following: maintaining the decorum of the \ncourtroom and eliminating the disruption of \ncourt proceedings when individuals confront \nphysical barriers; providing an accessible route \nto the witness stand and attorney area and clear \nfloor space to accommodate a wheelchair within \nthe witness area; establishing crucial lines of \nsight between the judge, jury, witnesses, and \nattorneys—which commenters described as \ncrucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury \nwill not miss key visual indicators of a witness; \nmaintaining a witness’s or attorney’s dignity and \ncredibility; shifting the focus from a witness’s \ndisability to the substance of that person’s \ntestimony; fostering the independence of an \nindividual with disability; allowing persons with \nmobility impairments to testify as witnesses, \nincluding as expert witnesses; ensuring the \nsafety of various participants in a courtroom \nproceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. \nOne commenter stated that equal access to \n\nthe well of the courtroom for both attorney \nand client is important for equal participation \nand representation in our court system. Other \ncommenters indicated that accessible judicial \nfacilities benefit a wide range of people, including \nmany persons without disabilities, senior citizens, \nparents using strollers with small children, and \nattorneys and court personnel wheeling documents \ninto the courtroom. One commenter urged the \nadoption of the work area provisions because they \nwould result in better workplace accessibility and \nincreased productivity. Several commenters urged \nthe adoption of the rule because it harmonizes \nthe ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards \ndeveloped by the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), and model codes that have \nbeen widely adopted by State and local building \ndepartments, thus increasing the prospects for \nbetter understanding and compliance with the \nADAAG by architects, designers, and builders. \n\nSeveral commenters mentioned the report \n‘‘Justice for All: Designing Accessible \nCourthouses’’ (Nov. 15, 2006), available at \nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/ report.htm  \n(Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June 24, 2010). \nThe report, prepared by the Courthouse Access \nAdvisory Committee for the Access Board, \ncontained recommendations for the Board’s use \nin developing and disseminating guidance on \naccessible courthouse design under the ADA and \nthe ABA. These commenters identified some of \nthe report’s best practices concerning courtroom \naccessibility for witness stands, jury boxes, and \nattorney areas; addressed the costs and benefits \narising from the use of accessible courtrooms; \nand recommended that the report be incorporated \ninto the Department’s final rule. With respect to \nexisting courtrooms, one commenter in this group \nsuggested that consideration be given to ensuring \nthat there are barrier-free emergency evacuation \nroutes for all persons in the courtroom, including \ndifferent evacuation routes for different classes \nof individuals given the unique nature of judicial \nfacilities and courtrooms. \n\n170 - Guidance and Analysis Department of Justice \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/report",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

                    "content": "Methods of providing \nthis information include, for example, the \npublication of information in handbooks, \nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \nto the public to describe a public entity’s \nprograms and activities; the display of in-\nformative posters in service centers and \nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\nmation by television or radio. In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160. The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

One commenter stated that, in order \nfor attorneys with disabilities to perform their \nprofessional duties to their clients and the court, it \nis essential that accessible courtrooms, conference \nrooms, law libraries, judicial chambers, and other \nareas of a courthouse be made barrier-free by \ntaking accessible design into account prior to \nconstruction. \n\nNumerous commenters identified a variety of \nbenefits that would accrue as a result of requiring \njudicial facilities to be accessible. These included \nthe following: maintaining the decorum of the \ncourtroom and eliminating the disruption of \ncourt proceedings when individuals confront \nphysical barriers; providing an accessible route \nto the witness stand and attorney area and clear \nfloor space to accommodate a wheelchair within \nthe witness area; establishing crucial lines of \nsight between the judge, jury, witnesses, and \nattorneys—which commenters described as \ncrucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury \nwill not miss key visual indicators of a witness; \nmaintaining a witness’s or attorney’s dignity and \ncredibility; shifting the focus from a witness’s \ndisability to the substance of that person’s \ntestimony; fostering the independence of an \nindividual with disability; allowing persons with \nmobility impairments to testify as witnesses, \nincluding as expert witnesses; ensuring the \nsafety of various participants in a courtroom \nproceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. \nOne commenter stated that equal access to \n\nthe well of the courtroom for both attorney \nand client is important for equal participation \nand representation in our court system. Other \ncommenters indicated that accessible judicial \nfacilities benefit a wide range of people, including \nmany persons without disabilities, senior citizens, \nparents using strollers with small children, and \nattorneys and court personnel wheeling documents \ninto the courtroom. One commenter urged the \nadoption of the work area provisions because they \nwould result in better workplace accessibility and \nincreased productivity. Several commenters urged \nthe adoption of the rule because it harmonizes \nthe ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards \ndeveloped by the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), and model codes that have \nbeen widely adopted by State and local building \ndepartments, thus increasing the prospects for \nbetter understanding and compliance with the \nADAAG by architects, designers, and builders. \n\nSeveral commenters mentioned the report \n‘‘Justice for All: Designing Accessible \nCourthouses’’ (Nov. 15, 2006), available at \nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/ report.htm  \n(Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June 24, 2010). \nThe report, prepared by the Courthouse Access \nAdvisory Committee for the Access Board, \ncontained recommendations for the Board’s use \nin developing and disseminating guidance on \naccessible courthouse design under the ADA and \nthe ABA. These commenters identified some of \nthe report’s best practices concerning courtroom \naccessibility for witness stands, jury boxes, and \nattorney areas; addressed the costs and benefits \narising from the use of accessible courtrooms; \nand recommended that the report be incorporated \ninto the Department’s final rule. With respect to \nexisting courtrooms, one commenter in this group \nsuggested that consideration be given to ensuring \nthat there are barrier-free emergency evacuation \nroutes for all persons in the courtroom, including \ndifferent evacuation routes for different classes \nof individuals given the unique nature of judicial \nfacilities and courtrooms. \n\n170 - Guidance and Analysis Department of Justice \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/report",

Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id.

In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160.

Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107.

Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F.

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id. Whether a par-\\nticular requirement is \\u2018\\u2018essential\\u2019\\u2019 will, of \\ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \\ncase. \\n\\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \\nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \\nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \\nFor example, the public entity must comply \\nwith this requirement when establishing \\nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio. In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160. The preamble to that section \\ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\\ndures \\n\\nConsistent with \\u00a7 35.105, self-evaluation, \\nthe final rule requires that public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504. In addition, \\u00a7 35.130 \\nincludes a number of provisions derived from \\ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\\ntions implementing section 504\"}}]}\n\n## User Question\nUnderstanding legal protection for age discrimination."

In the United States, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older [doc0]. This means that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants based on their age in hiring, firing, promotions, or any other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees, including state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and the federal government. It is important for employers to be aware of the specific provisions of the ADEA to ensure compliance with the law [doc1]. Additionally, it's essential for employers to create a work environment that promotes inclusivity and prevents age discrimination through policies, training, and a clear grievance procedure for addressing any complaints related to age discrimination.\n\nEmployers should also be mindful of the need for effective communication with individuals of all ages, as outlined in the ADEA and related regulations. This includes providing clear information about employment opportunities, benefits, and other relevant aspects of the workplace in a manner that is accessible to all employees, regardless of age [doc1].\n\nIn summary, the ADEA provides important legal protections against age discrimination in the workplace, and employers must proactively ensure compliance with its provisions to foster a fair and inclusive work environment [doc0].",

          "content": "This para-\ngraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionary \n\n194 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\npolicies or practices and nonessential poli-\ncies and practices that are neutral on their \nface, but deny individuals with disabilities \nan effective opportunity to participate. This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

One commenter stated that, in order \nfor attorneys with disabilities to perform their \nprofessional duties to their clients and the court, it \nis essential that accessible courtrooms, conference \nrooms, law libraries, judicial chambers, and other \nareas of a courthouse be made barrier-free by \ntaking accessible design into account prior to \nconstruction. \n\nNumerous commenters identified a variety of \nbenefits that would accrue as a result of requiring \njudicial facilities to be accessible. These included \nthe following: maintaining the decorum of the \ncourtroom and eliminating the disruption of \ncourt proceedings when individuals confront \nphysical barriers; providing an accessible route \nto the witness stand and attorney area and clear \nfloor space to accommodate a wheelchair within \nthe witness area; establishing crucial lines of \nsight between the judge, jury, witnesses, and \nattorneys—which commenters described as \ncrucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury \nwill not miss key visual indicators of a witness; \nmaintaining a witness’s or attorney’s dignity and \ncredibility; shifting the focus from a witness’s \ndisability to the substance of that person’s \ntestimony; fostering the independence of an \nindividual with disability; allowing persons with \nmobility impairments to testify as witnesses, \nincluding as expert witnesses; ensuring the \nsafety of various participants in a courtroom \nproceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. \nOne commenter stated that equal access to \n\nthe well of the courtroom for both attorney \nand client is important for equal participation \nand representation in our court system. Other \ncommenters indicated that accessible judicial \nfacilities benefit a wide range of people, including \nmany persons without disabilities, senior citizens, \nparents using strollers with small children, and \nattorneys and court personnel wheeling documents \ninto the courtroom. One commenter urged the \nadoption of the work area provisions because they \nwould result in better workplace accessibility and \nincreased productivity. Several commenters urged \nthe adoption of the rule because it harmonizes \nthe ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards \ndeveloped by the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), and model codes that have \nbeen widely adopted by State and local building \ndepartments, thus increasing the prospects for \nbetter understanding and compliance with the \nADAAG by architects, designers, and builders. \n\nSeveral commenters mentioned the report \n‘‘Justice for All: Designing Accessible \nCourthouses’’ (Nov. 15, 2006), available at \nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/ report.htm  \n(Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June 24, 2010). \nThe report, prepared by the Courthouse Access \nAdvisory Committee for the Access Board, \ncontained recommendations for the Board’s use \nin developing and disseminating guidance on \naccessible courthouse design under the ADA and \nthe ABA. These commenters identified some of \nthe report’s best practices concerning courtroom \naccessibility for witness stands, jury boxes, and \nattorney areas; addressed the costs and benefits \narising from the use of accessible courtrooms; \nand recommended that the report be incorporated \ninto the Department’s final rule. With respect to \nexisting courtrooms, one commenter in this group \nsuggested that consideration be given to ensuring \nthat there are barrier-free emergency evacuation \nroutes for all persons in the courtroom, including \ndifferent evacuation routes for different classes \nof individuals given the unique nature of judicial \nfacilities and courtrooms. \n\n170 - Guidance and Analysis Department of Justice \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/report",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

One commenter stated that, in order \nfor attorneys with disabilities to perform their \nprofessional duties to their clients and the court, it \nis essential that accessible courtrooms, conference \nrooms, law libraries, judicial chambers, and other \nareas of a courthouse be made barrier-free by \ntaking accessible design into account prior to \nconstruction. \n\nNumerous commenters identified a variety of \nbenefits that would accrue as a result of requiring \njudicial facilities to be accessible. These included \nthe following: maintaining the decorum of the \ncourtroom and eliminating the disruption of \ncourt proceedings when individuals confront \nphysical barriers; providing an accessible route \nto the witness stand and attorney area and clear \nfloor space to accommodate a wheelchair within \nthe witness area; establishing crucial lines of \nsight between the judge, jury, witnesses, and \nattorneys—which commenters described as \ncrucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury \nwill not miss key visual indicators of a witness; \nmaintaining a witness’s or attorney’s dignity and \ncredibility; shifting the focus from a witness’s \ndisability to the substance of that person’s \ntestimony; fostering the independence of an \nindividual with disability; allowing persons with \nmobility impairments to testify as witnesses, \nincluding as expert witnesses; ensuring the \nsafety of various participants in a courtroom \nproceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. \nOne commenter stated that equal access to \n\nthe well of the courtroom for both attorney \nand client is important for equal participation \nand representation in our court system. Other \ncommenters indicated that accessible judicial \nfacilities benefit a wide range of people, including \nmany persons without disabilities, senior citizens, \nparents using strollers with small children, and \nattorneys and court personnel wheeling documents \ninto the courtroom. One commenter urged the \nadoption of the work area provisions because they \nwould result in better workplace accessibility and \nincreased productivity. Several commenters urged \nthe adoption of the rule because it harmonizes \nthe ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards \ndeveloped by the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), and model codes that have \nbeen widely adopted by State and local building \ndepartments, thus increasing the prospects for \nbetter understanding and compliance with the \nADAAG by architects, designers, and builders. \n\nSeveral commenters mentioned the report \n‘‘Justice for All: Designing Accessible \nCourthouses’’ (Nov. 15, 2006), available at \nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/ report.htm  \n(Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June 24, 2010). \nThe report, prepared by the Courthouse Access \nAdvisory Committee for the Access Board, \ncontained recommendations for the Board’s use \nin developing and disseminating guidance on \naccessible courthouse design under the ADA and \nthe ABA. These commenters identified some of \nthe report’s best practices concerning courtroom \naccessibility for witness stands, jury boxes, and \nattorney areas; addressed the costs and benefits \narising from the use of accessible courtrooms; \nand recommended that the report be incorporated \ninto the Department’s final rule. With respect to \nexisting courtrooms, one commenter in this group \nsuggested that consideration be given to ensuring \nthat there are barrier-free emergency evacuation \nroutes for all persons in the courtroom, including \ndifferent evacuation routes for different classes \nof individuals given the unique nature of judicial \nfacilities and courtrooms. \n\n170 - Guidance and Analysis Department of Justice \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/report",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160.

Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107.

Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F.

One commenter stated that, in order \nfor attorneys with disabilities to perform their \nprofessional duties to their clients and the court, it \nis essential that accessible courtrooms, conference \nrooms, law libraries, judicial chambers, and other \nareas of a courthouse be made barrier-free by \ntaking accessible design into account prior to \nconstruction. \n\nNumerous commenters identified a variety of \nbenefits that would accrue as a result of requiring \njudicial facilities to be accessible. These included \nthe following: maintaining the decorum of the \ncourtroom and eliminating the disruption of \ncourt proceedings when individuals confront \nphysical barriers; providing an accessible route \nto the witness stand and attorney area and clear \nfloor space to accommodate a wheelchair within \nthe witness area; establishing crucial lines of \nsight between the judge, jury, witnesses, and \nattorneys—which commenters described as \ncrucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury \nwill not miss key visual indicators of a witness; \nmaintaining a witness’s or attorney’s dignity and \ncredibility; shifting the focus from a witness’s \ndisability to the substance of that person’s \ntestimony; fostering the independence of an \nindividual with disability; allowing persons with \nmobility impairments to testify as witnesses, \nincluding as expert witnesses; ensuring the \nsafety of various participants in a courtroom \nproceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. \nOne commenter stated that equal access to \n\nthe well of the courtroom for both attorney \nand client is important for equal participation \nand representation in our court system. Other \ncommenters indicated that accessible judicial \nfacilities benefit a wide range of people, including \nmany persons without disabilities, senior citizens, \nparents using strollers with small children, and \nattorneys and court personnel wheeling documents \ninto the courtroom. One commenter urged the \nadoption of the work area provisions because they \nwould result in better workplace accessibility and \nincreased productivity. Several commenters urged \nthe adoption of the rule because it harmonizes \nthe ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards \ndeveloped by the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), and model codes that have \nbeen widely adopted by State and local building \ndepartments, thus increasing the prospects for \nbetter understanding and compliance with the \nADAAG by architects, designers, and builders. \n\nSeveral commenters mentioned the report \n‘‘Justice for All: Designing Accessible \nCourthouses’’ (Nov. 15, 2006), available at \nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/ report.htm  \n(Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June 24, 2010). \nThe report, prepared by the Courthouse Access \nAdvisory Committee for the Access Board, \ncontained recommendations for the Board’s use \nin developing and disseminating guidance on \naccessible courthouse design under the ADA and \nthe ABA. These commenters identified some of \nthe report’s best practices concerning courtroom \naccessibility for witness stands, jury boxes, and \nattorney areas; addressed the costs and benefits \narising from the use of accessible courtrooms; \nand recommended that the report be incorporated \ninto the Department’s final rule. With respect to \nexisting courtrooms, one commenter in this group \nsuggested that consideration be given to ensuring \nthat there are barrier-free emergency evacuation \nroutes for all persons in the courtroom, including \ndifferent evacuation routes for different classes \nof individuals given the unique nature of judicial \nfacilities and courtrooms. \n\n170 - Guidance and Analysis Department of Justice \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/report",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

            "content": "Methods of providing \nthis information include, for example, the \npublication of information in handbooks, \nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \nto the public to describe a public entity’s \nprograms and activities; the display of in-\nformative posters in service centers and \nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\nmation by television or radio. In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160. The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

These included \nthe following: maintaining the decorum of the \ncourtroom and eliminating the disruption of \ncourt proceedings when individuals confront \nphysical barriers; providing an accessible route \nto the witness stand and attorney area and clear \nfloor space to accommodate a wheelchair within \nthe witness area; establishing crucial lines of \nsight between the judge, jury, witnesses, and \nattorneys—which commenters described as \ncrucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury \nwill not miss key visual indicators of a witness; \nmaintaining a witness’s or attorney’s dignity and \ncredibility; shifting the focus from a witness’s \ndisability to the substance of that person’s \ntestimony; fostering the independence of an \nindividual with disability; allowing persons with \nmobility impairments to testify as witnesses, \nincluding as expert witnesses; ensuring the \nsafety of various participants in a courtroom \nproceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. \nOne commenter stated that equal access to \n\nthe well of the courtroom for both attorney \nand client is important for equal participation \nand representation in our court system. Other \ncommenters indicated that accessible judicial \nfacilities benefit a wide range of people, including \nmany persons without disabilities, senior citizens, \nparents using strollers with small children, and \nattorneys and court personnel wheeling documents \ninto the courtroom. One commenter urged the \nadoption of the work area provisions because they \nwould result in better workplace accessibility and \nincreased productivity. Several commenters urged \nthe adoption of the rule because it harmonizes \nthe ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards \ndeveloped by the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), and model codes that have \nbeen widely adopted by State and local building \ndepartments, thus increasing the prospects for \nbetter understanding and compliance with the \nADAAG by architects, designers, and builders. \n\nSeveral commenters mentioned the report \n‘‘Justice for All: Designing Accessible \nCourthouses’’ (Nov. 15, 2006), available at \nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/ report.htm  \n(Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June 24, 2010). \nThe report, prepared by the Courthouse Access \nAdvisory Committee for the Access Board, \ncontained recommendations for the Board’s use \nin developing and disseminating guidance on \naccessible courthouse design under the ADA and \nthe ABA. These commenters identified some of \nthe report’s best practices concerning courtroom \naccessibility for witness stands, jury boxes, and \nattorney areas; addressed the costs and benefits \narising from the use of accessible courtrooms; \nand recommended that the report be incorporated \ninto the Department’s final rule. With respect to \nexisting courtrooms, one commenter in this group \nsuggested that consideration be given to ensuring \nthat there are barrier-free emergency evacuation \nroutes for all persons in the courtroom, including \ndifferent evacuation routes for different classes \nof individuals given the unique nature of judicial \nfacilities and courtrooms. \n\n170 - Guidance and Analysis Department of Justice \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/report",

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id.

In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio. In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160. The preamble to that section \\ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\\ndures \\n\\nConsistent with \\u00a7 35.105, self-evaluation, \\nthe final rule requires that public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504. In addition, \\u00a7 35.130 \\nincludes a number of provisions derived from \\ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\\ntions implementing section 504\"}}]}",

Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams.

Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504.

One commenter stated that, in order \nfor attorneys with disabilities to perform their \nprofessional duties to their clients and the court, it \nis essential that accessible courtrooms, conference \nrooms, law libraries, judicial chambers, and other \nareas of a courthouse be made barrier-free by \ntaking accessible design into account prior to \nconstruction. \n\nNumerous commenters identified a variety of \nbenefits that would accrue as a result of requiring \njudicial facilities to be accessible. These included \nthe following: maintaining the decorum of the \ncourtroom and eliminating the disruption of \ncourt proceedings when individuals confront \nphysical barriers; providing an accessible route \nto the witness stand and attorney area and clear \nfloor space to accommodate a wheelchair within \nthe witness area; establishing crucial lines of \nsight between the judge, jury, witnesses, and \nattorneys—which commenters described as \ncrucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury \nwill not miss key visual indicators of a witness; \nmaintaining a witness’s or attorney’s dignity and \ncredibility; shifting the focus from a witness’s \ndisability to the substance of that person’s \ntestimony; fostering the independence of an \nindividual with disability; allowing persons with \nmobility impairments to testify as witnesses, \nincluding as expert witnesses; ensuring the \nsafety of various participants in a courtroom \nproceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. \nOne commenter stated that equal access to \n\nthe well of the courtroom for both attorney \nand client is important for equal participation \nand representation in our court system. Other \ncommenters indicated that accessible judicial \nfacilities benefit a wide range of people, including \nmany persons without disabilities, senior citizens, \nparents using strollers with small children, and \nattorneys and court personnel wheeling documents \ninto the courtroom. One commenter urged the \nadoption of the work area provisions because they \nwould result in better workplace accessibility and \nincreased productivity. Several commenters urged \nthe adoption of the rule because it harmonizes \nthe ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards \ndeveloped by the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), and model codes that have \nbeen widely adopted by State and local building \ndepartments, thus increasing the prospects for \nbetter understanding and compliance with the \nADAAG by architects, designers, and builders. \n\nSeveral commenters mentioned the report \n‘‘Justice for All: Designing Accessible \nCourthouses’’ (Nov. 15, 2006), available at \nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/ report.htm  \n(Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June 24, 2010). \nThe report, prepared by the Courthouse Access \nAdvisory Committee for the Access Board, \ncontained recommendations for the Board’s use \nin developing and disseminating guidance on \naccessible courthouse design under the ADA and \nthe ABA. These commenters identified some of \nthe report’s best practices concerning courtroom \naccessibility for witness stands, jury boxes, and \nattorney areas; addressed the costs and benefits \narising from the use of accessible courtrooms; \nand recommended that the report be incorporated \ninto the Department’s final rule. With respect to \nexisting courtrooms, one commenter in this group \nsuggested that consideration be given to ensuring \nthat there are barrier-free emergency evacuation \nroutes for all persons in the courtroom, including \ndifferent evacuation routes for different classes \nof individuals given the unique nature of judicial \nfacilities and courtrooms. \n\n170 - Guidance and Analysis Department of Justice \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/caac/report",

Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition.

      "output": "Age discrimination is a significant concern in the workplace, and it's crucial for employers to understand the legal protections in place to prevent such discrimination. In the United States, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older [doc0]. This means that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants based on their age in hiring, firing, promotions, or any other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees, including state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and the federal government. It is important for employers to be aware of the specific provisions of the ADEA to ensure compliance with the law [doc1]. Additionally, it's essential for employers to create a work environment that promotes inclusivity and prevents age discrimination through policies, training, and a clear grievance procedure for addressing any complaints related to age discrimination.\n\nEmployers should also be mindful of the need for effective communication with individuals of all ages, as outlined in the ADEA and related regulations. This includes providing clear information about employment opportunities, benefits, and other relevant aspects of the workplace in a manner that is accessible to all employees, regardless of age [doc1].\n\nIn summary, the ADEA provides important legal protections against age discrimination in the workplace, and employers must proactively ensure compliance with its provisions to foster a fair and inclusive work environment [doc0].",

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id. Whether a par-\\nticular requirement is \\u2018\\u2018essential\\u2019\\u2019 will, of \\ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \\ncase. \\n\\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \\nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \\nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \\nFor example, the public entity must comply \\nwith this requirement when establishing \\nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio.
