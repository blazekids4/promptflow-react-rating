        "reply": "Age discrimination is a significant concern in the workplace, and it's crucial for employers to understand the legal protections in place to prevent such discrimination. In the United States, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older [doc0]. This means that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants based on their age in hiring, firing, promotions, or any other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees, including state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and the federal government. It is important for employers to be aware of the specific provisions of the ADEA to ensure compliance with the law [doc1]. Additionally, it's essential for employers to create a work environment that promotes inclusivity and prevents age discrimination through policies, training, and a clear grievance procedure for addressing any age discrimination complaints.\n\nEmployers should also be mindful of the need for effective communication with individuals of all ages, as outlined in the ADEA and related regulations. This includes providing clear information about employment opportunities, benefits, and other relevant aspects of the workplace in a manner that is accessible to all employees, regardless of age [doc1].\n\nBy understanding and adhering to the legal protections provided by the ADEA, employers can create a fair and inclusive work environment that respects the rights of employees of all age groups [doc0].",

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id. Whether a par-\\nticular requirement is \\u2018\\u2018essential\\u2019\\u2019 will, of \\ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \\ncase. \\n\\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \\nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \\nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \\nFor example, the public entity must comply \\nwith this requirement when establishing \\nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio. In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160. The preamble to that section \\ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\\ndures \\n\\nConsistent with \\u00a7 35.105, self-evaluation, \\nthe final rule requires that public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504. In addition, \\u00a7 35.130 \\nincludes a number of provisions derived from \\ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\\ntions implementing section 504\"}}]}",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

                  "content": "Methods of providing \nthis information include, for example, the \npublication of information in handbooks, \nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \nto the public to describe a public entity’s \nprograms and activities; the display of in-\nformative posters in service centers and \nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\nmation by television or radio. In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160. The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

                  "content": "In the proposed regulation the Department \ncross-referenced the regulations imple-\nmenting title I of the ADA, issued by the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission \nat 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance standard \nfor § 35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of \ncoverage and effective date of coverage \nunder title II would have been coextensive \nwith title I. In the final regulation this lan-\nguage is modified slightly. Subparagraph (1) \nof new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the \nstandards established by the Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR \npart 1630 will be the applicable compliance \nstandards if the public entity is subject to \ntitle I. If the public entity is not covered by \ntitle I, or until it is covered by title I, sub-\n\nparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 \nstandards for what constitutes employment \ndiscrimination, as established by the Depart-\nment of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards \nfor title I of the ADA and section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act are for the most part \nidentical because title I of the ADA was \nbased on requirements set forth in regula-\ntions implementing section 504. \n\nThe Department, together with the other \nFederal agencies responsible for the enforce-\nment of Federal laws prohibiting employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability, recognizes the potential for jurisdic-\ntional overlap that exists with respect to \ncoverage of public entities and the need to \navoid problems related to overlapping cov-\nerage. The other Federal agencies include \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission, which is the agency primarily re-\nsponsible for enforcement of title I of the \nADA, the Department of Labor, which is the \nagency responsible for enforcement of sec-\ntion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and \n26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal \nfinancial assistance, which are responsible \nfor enforcing section 504 in those programs. \nSection 107 of the ADA requires that coordi-\nnation mechanisms be developed in connec-\ntion with the administrative enforcement of \ncomplaints alleging discrimination under \ntitle I and complaints alleging discrimina-\ntion in employment in violation of the Reha-\nbilitation Act. Although the ADA does not \nspecifically require inclusion of employment \ncomplaints under title II in the coordinating \nmechanisms required by title I, Federal in-\nvestigations of title II employment com-\nplaints will be coordinated on a government-\nwide basis also. The Department is currently \nworking with the EEOC and other affected \nFederal agencies to develop effective coordi-\nnating mechanisms, and final regulations on \nthis issue will be issued on or before January \n26, 1992. \n\nSubpart D—Program Accessibility \n\nSection 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited \n\nSection 35.149 states the general non-\ndiscrimination principle underlying the pro-\ngram accessibility requirements of §§ 35.150 \nand 35.151. \n\nSection 35.150 Existing Facilities \n\nConsistent with section 204(b) of the Act, \nthis regulation adopts the program accessi-\nbility concept found in the section 504 regu-\nlations for federally conducted programs or \nactivities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). The concept \nof ‘‘program accessibility’’ was first used in \nthe section 504 regulation adopted by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare \nfor its federally assisted programs and ac-\ntivities in 1977. It allowed recipients to make \n\n200 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\ntheir federally assisted programs and activi-\nties available to individuals with disabilities \nwithout extensive retrofitting of their exist-\ning buildings and facilities, by offering those \nprograms through alternative methods. Pro-\ngram accessibility has proven to be a useful \napproach and was adopted in the regulations \nissued for programs and activities conducted \nby Federal Executive agencies. The Act pro-\nvides that the concept of program access will \ncontinue to apply with respect to facilities \nnow in existence, because the cost of retro-\nfitting existing facilities is often prohibitive. \n\nSection 35.150 requires that each service, \nprogram, or activity conducted by a public \nentity, when viewed in its entirety, be read-\nily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

                    "content": "Methods of providing \nthis information include, for example, the \npublication of information in handbooks, \nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \nto the public to describe a public entity’s \nprograms and activities; the display of in-\nformative posters in service centers and \nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\nmation by television or radio. In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160. The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

                    "content": "In the proposed regulation the Department \ncross-referenced the regulations imple-\nmenting title I of the ADA, issued by the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission \nat 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance standard \nfor § 35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of \ncoverage and effective date of coverage \nunder title II would have been coextensive \nwith title I. In the final regulation this lan-\nguage is modified slightly. Subparagraph (1) \nof new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the \nstandards established by the Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR \npart 1630 will be the applicable compliance \nstandards if the public entity is subject to \ntitle I. If the public entity is not covered by \ntitle I, or until it is covered by title I, sub-\n\nparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 \nstandards for what constitutes employment \ndiscrimination, as established by the Depart-\nment of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards \nfor title I of the ADA and section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act are for the most part \nidentical because title I of the ADA was \nbased on requirements set forth in regula-\ntions implementing section 504. \n\nThe Department, together with the other \nFederal agencies responsible for the enforce-\nment of Federal laws prohibiting employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability, recognizes the potential for jurisdic-\ntional overlap that exists with respect to \ncoverage of public entities and the need to \navoid problems related to overlapping cov-\nerage. The other Federal agencies include \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission, which is the agency primarily re-\nsponsible for enforcement of title I of the \nADA, the Department of Labor, which is the \nagency responsible for enforcement of sec-\ntion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and \n26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal \nfinancial assistance, which are responsible \nfor enforcing section 504 in those programs. \nSection 107 of the ADA requires that coordi-\nnation mechanisms be developed in connec-\ntion with the administrative enforcement of \ncomplaints alleging discrimination under \ntitle I and complaints alleging discrimina-\ntion in employment in violation of the Reha-\nbilitation Act. Although the ADA does not \nspecifically require inclusion of employment \ncomplaints under title II in the coordinating \nmechanisms required by title I, Federal in-\nvestigations of title II employment com-\nplaints will be coordinated on a government-\nwide basis also. The Department is currently \nworking with the EEOC and other affected \nFederal agencies to develop effective coordi-\nnating mechanisms, and final regulations on \nthis issue will be issued on or before January \n26, 1992. \n\nSubpart D—Program Accessibility \n\nSection 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited \n\nSection 35.149 states the general non-\ndiscrimination principle underlying the pro-\ngram accessibility requirements of §§ 35.150 \nand 35.151. \n\nSection 35.150 Existing Facilities \n\nConsistent with section 204(b) of the Act, \nthis regulation adopts the program accessi-\nbility concept found in the section 504 regu-\nlations for federally conducted programs or \nactivities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). The concept \nof ‘‘program accessibility’’ was first used in \nthe section 504 regulation adopted by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare \nfor its federally assisted programs and ac-\ntivities in 1977. It allowed recipients to make \n\n200 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\ntheir federally assisted programs and activi-\nties available to individuals with disabilities \nwithout extensive retrofitting of their exist-\ning buildings and facilities, by offering those \nprograms through alternative methods. Pro-\ngram accessibility has proven to be a useful \napproach and was adopted in the regulations \nissued for programs and activities conducted \nby Federal Executive agencies. The Act pro-\nvides that the concept of program access will \ncontinue to apply with respect to facilities \nnow in existence, because the cost of retro-\nfitting existing facilities is often prohibitive. \n\nSection 35.150 requires that each service, \nprogram, or activity conducted by a public \nentity, when viewed in its entirety, be read-\nily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities",

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id.

In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio. In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160. The preamble to that section \\ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\\ndures \\n\\nConsistent with \\u00a7 35.105, self-evaluation, \\nthe final rule requires that public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504.

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id. Whether a par-\\nticular requirement is \\u2018\\u2018essential\\u2019\\u2019 will, of \\ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \\ncase. \\n\\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \\nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \\nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \\nFor example, the public entity must comply \\nwith this requirement when establishing \\nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio. In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160. The preamble to that section \\ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\\ndures \\n\\nConsistent with \\u00a7 35.105, self-evaluation, \\nthe final rule requires that public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504. In addition, \\u00a7 35.130 \\nincludes a number of provisions derived from \\ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\\ntions implementing section 504\"}}]}\n\n## User Question\nUnderstanding legal protection for age discrimination."

In the United States, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older [doc0]. This means that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants based on their age in hiring, firing, promotions, or any other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees, including state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and the federal government. It is important for employers to be aware of the specific provisions of the ADEA to ensure compliance with the law [doc1]. Additionally, it's essential for employers to create a work environment that promotes inclusivity and prevents age discrimination through policies, training, and a clear grievance procedure for addressing any age discrimination complaints.\n\nEmployers should also be mindful of the need for effective communication with individuals of all ages, as outlined in the ADEA and related regulations. This includes providing clear information about employment opportunities, benefits, and other relevant aspects of the workplace in a manner that is accessible to all employees, regardless of age [doc1].\n\nBy understanding and adhering to the legal protections provided by the ADEA, employers can create a fair and inclusive work environment that respects the rights of employees of all age groups [doc0].",

          "content": "This para-\ngraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionary \n\n194 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\npolicies or practices and nonessential poli-\ncies and practices that are neutral on their \nface, but deny individuals with disabilities \nan effective opportunity to participate. This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

          "content": "In the proposed regulation the Department \ncross-referenced the regulations imple-\nmenting title I of the ADA, issued by the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission \nat 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance standard \nfor § 35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of \ncoverage and effective date of coverage \nunder title II would have been coextensive \nwith title I. In the final regulation this lan-\nguage is modified slightly. Subparagraph (1) \nof new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the \nstandards established by the Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR \npart 1630 will be the applicable compliance \nstandards if the public entity is subject to \ntitle I. If the public entity is not covered by \ntitle I, or until it is covered by title I, sub-\n\nparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 \nstandards for what constitutes employment \ndiscrimination, as established by the Depart-\nment of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards \nfor title I of the ADA and section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act are for the most part \nidentical because title I of the ADA was \nbased on requirements set forth in regula-\ntions implementing section 504. \n\nThe Department, together with the other \nFederal agencies responsible for the enforce-\nment of Federal laws prohibiting employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability, recognizes the potential for jurisdic-\ntional overlap that exists with respect to \ncoverage of public entities and the need to \navoid problems related to overlapping cov-\nerage. The other Federal agencies include \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission, which is the agency primarily re-\nsponsible for enforcement of title I of the \nADA, the Department of Labor, which is the \nagency responsible for enforcement of sec-\ntion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and \n26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal \nfinancial assistance, which are responsible \nfor enforcing section 504 in those programs. \nSection 107 of the ADA requires that coordi-\nnation mechanisms be developed in connec-\ntion with the administrative enforcement of \ncomplaints alleging discrimination under \ntitle I and complaints alleging discrimina-\ntion in employment in violation of the Reha-\nbilitation Act. Although the ADA does not \nspecifically require inclusion of employment \ncomplaints under title II in the coordinating \nmechanisms required by title I, Federal in-\nvestigations of title II employment com-\nplaints will be coordinated on a government-\nwide basis also. The Department is currently \nworking with the EEOC and other affected \nFederal agencies to develop effective coordi-\nnating mechanisms, and final regulations on \nthis issue will be issued on or before January \n26, 1992. \n\nSubpart D—Program Accessibility \n\nSection 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited \n\nSection 35.149 states the general non-\ndiscrimination principle underlying the pro-\ngram accessibility requirements of §§ 35.150 \nand 35.151. \n\nSection 35.150 Existing Facilities \n\nConsistent with section 204(b) of the Act, \nthis regulation adopts the program accessi-\nbility concept found in the section 504 regu-\nlations for federally conducted programs or \nactivities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). The concept \nof ‘‘program accessibility’’ was first used in \nthe section 504 regulation adopted by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare \nfor its federally assisted programs and ac-\ntivities in 1977. It allowed recipients to make \n\n200 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\ntheir federally assisted programs and activi-\nties available to individuals with disabilities \nwithout extensive retrofitting of their exist-\ning buildings and facilities, by offering those \nprograms through alternative methods. Pro-\ngram accessibility has proven to be a useful \napproach and was adopted in the regulations \nissued for programs and activities conducted \nby Federal Executive agencies. The Act pro-\nvides that the concept of program access will \ncontinue to apply with respect to facilities \nnow in existence, because the cost of retro-\nfitting existing facilities is often prohibitive. \n\nSection 35.150 requires that each service, \nprogram, or activity conducted by a public \nentity, when viewed in its entirety, be read-\nily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

              "content": "In the proposed regulation the Department \ncross-referenced the regulations imple-\nmenting title I of the ADA, issued by the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission \nat 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance standard \nfor § 35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of \ncoverage and effective date of coverage \nunder title II would have been coextensive \nwith title I. In the final regulation this lan-\nguage is modified slightly. Subparagraph (1) \nof new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the \nstandards established by the Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR \npart 1630 will be the applicable compliance \nstandards if the public entity is subject to \ntitle I. If the public entity is not covered by \ntitle I, or until it is covered by title I, sub-\n\nparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 \nstandards for what constitutes employment \ndiscrimination, as established by the Depart-\nment of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards \nfor title I of the ADA and section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act are for the most part \nidentical because title I of the ADA was \nbased on requirements set forth in regula-\ntions implementing section 504. \n\nThe Department, together with the other \nFederal agencies responsible for the enforce-\nment of Federal laws prohibiting employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability, recognizes the potential for jurisdic-\ntional overlap that exists with respect to \ncoverage of public entities and the need to \navoid problems related to overlapping cov-\nerage. The other Federal agencies include \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission, which is the agency primarily re-\nsponsible for enforcement of title I of the \nADA, the Department of Labor, which is the \nagency responsible for enforcement of sec-\ntion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and \n26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal \nfinancial assistance, which are responsible \nfor enforcing section 504 in those programs. \nSection 107 of the ADA requires that coordi-\nnation mechanisms be developed in connec-\ntion with the administrative enforcement of \ncomplaints alleging discrimination under \ntitle I and complaints alleging discrimina-\ntion in employment in violation of the Reha-\nbilitation Act. Although the ADA does not \nspecifically require inclusion of employment \ncomplaints under title II in the coordinating \nmechanisms required by title I, Federal in-\nvestigations of title II employment com-\nplaints will be coordinated on a government-\nwide basis also. The Department is currently \nworking with the EEOC and other affected \nFederal agencies to develop effective coordi-\nnating mechanisms, and final regulations on \nthis issue will be issued on or before January \n26, 1992. \n\nSubpart D—Program Accessibility \n\nSection 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited \n\nSection 35.149 states the general non-\ndiscrimination principle underlying the pro-\ngram accessibility requirements of §§ 35.150 \nand 35.151. \n\nSection 35.150 Existing Facilities \n\nConsistent with section 204(b) of the Act, \nthis regulation adopts the program accessi-\nbility concept found in the section 504 regu-\nlations for federally conducted programs or \nactivities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). The concept \nof ‘‘program accessibility’’ was first used in \nthe section 504 regulation adopted by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare \nfor its federally assisted programs and ac-\ntivities in 1977. It allowed recipients to make \n\n200 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\ntheir federally assisted programs and activi-\nties available to individuals with disabilities \nwithout extensive retrofitting of their exist-\ning buildings and facilities, by offering those \nprograms through alternative methods. Pro-\ngram accessibility has proven to be a useful \napproach and was adopted in the regulations \nissued for programs and activities conducted \nby Federal Executive agencies. The Act pro-\nvides that the concept of program access will \ncontinue to apply with respect to facilities \nnow in existence, because the cost of retro-\nfitting existing facilities is often prohibitive. \n\nSection 35.150 requires that each service, \nprogram, or activity conducted by a public \nentity, when viewed in its entirety, be read-\nily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

          "content": "In the proposed regulation the Department \ncross-referenced the regulations imple-\nmenting title I of the ADA, issued by the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission \nat 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance standard \nfor § 35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of \ncoverage and effective date of coverage \nunder title II would have been coextensive \nwith title I. In the final regulation this lan-\nguage is modified slightly. Subparagraph (1) \nof new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the \nstandards established by the Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR \npart 1630 will be the applicable compliance \nstandards if the public entity is subject to \ntitle I. If the public entity is not covered by \ntitle I, or until it is covered by title I, sub-\n\nparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 \nstandards for what constitutes employment \ndiscrimination, as established by the Depart-\nment of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards \nfor title I of the ADA and section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act are for the most part \nidentical because title I of the ADA was \nbased on requirements set forth in regula-\ntions implementing section 504. \n\nThe Department, together with the other \nFederal agencies responsible for the enforce-\nment of Federal laws prohibiting employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability, recognizes the potential for jurisdic-\ntional overlap that exists with respect to \ncoverage of public entities and the need to \navoid problems related to overlapping cov-\nerage. The other Federal agencies include \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission, which is the agency primarily re-\nsponsible for enforcement of title I of the \nADA, the Department of Labor, which is the \nagency responsible for enforcement of sec-\ntion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and \n26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal \nfinancial assistance, which are responsible \nfor enforcing section 504 in those programs. \nSection 107 of the ADA requires that coordi-\nnation mechanisms be developed in connec-\ntion with the administrative enforcement of \ncomplaints alleging discrimination under \ntitle I and complaints alleging discrimina-\ntion in employment in violation of the Reha-\nbilitation Act. Although the ADA does not \nspecifically require inclusion of employment \ncomplaints under title II in the coordinating \nmechanisms required by title I, Federal in-\nvestigations of title II employment com-\nplaints will be coordinated on a government-\nwide basis also. The Department is currently \nworking with the EEOC and other affected \nFederal agencies to develop effective coordi-\nnating mechanisms, and final regulations on \nthis issue will be issued on or before January \n26, 1992. \n\nSubpart D—Program Accessibility \n\nSection 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited \n\nSection 35.149 states the general non-\ndiscrimination principle underlying the pro-\ngram accessibility requirements of §§ 35.150 \nand 35.151. \n\nSection 35.150 Existing Facilities \n\nConsistent with section 204(b) of the Act, \nthis regulation adopts the program accessi-\nbility concept found in the section 504 regu-\nlations for federally conducted programs or \nactivities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). The concept \nof ‘‘program accessibility’’ was first used in \nthe section 504 regulation adopted by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare \nfor its federally assisted programs and ac-\ntivities in 1977. It allowed recipients to make \n\n200 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\ntheir federally assisted programs and activi-\nties available to individuals with disabilities \nwithout extensive retrofitting of their exist-\ning buildings and facilities, by offering those \nprograms through alternative methods. Pro-\ngram accessibility has proven to be a useful \napproach and was adopted in the regulations \nissued for programs and activities conducted \nby Federal Executive agencies. The Act pro-\nvides that the concept of program access will \ncontinue to apply with respect to facilities \nnow in existence, because the cost of retro-\nfitting existing facilities is often prohibitive. \n\nSection 35.150 requires that each service, \nprogram, or activity conducted by a public \nentity, when viewed in its entirety, be read-\nily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities",

This \nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \n‘‘These statements would ring hollow if the \nresulting legislation could not rectify the \nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\nnated by effect as well as by design.’’ Id. at \n297 (footnote omitted). \n\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \nprohibition enunciated in § 35.130(b)(3) to the \nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\ntional buildings at an existing site. \n\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\nnation on the basis of disability. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\ncation. A person is a ‘‘qualified individual \nwith a disability’’ with respect to licensing \nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \nthe license or certification (see § 35.104). \n\nA number of commenters were troubled by \nthe phrase ‘‘essential eligibility require-\nments’’ as applied to State licensing require-\nments, especially those for health care pro-\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \nprograms to which the definition of ‘‘quali-\nfied individual with a disability’’ applies, it \nis not possible to use more specific language \nin the definition. The phrase ‘‘essential eligi-\nbility requirements,’’ however, is taken from \nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \nCourt held that section 504 does not require \nan institution to ‘‘lower or effect substantial \nmodifications of standards to accommodate \na handicapped person,’’ 442 U.S. at 413, and \nthat the school had established that the \nplaintiff was not ‘‘qualified’’ because she was \nnot able to ‘‘serve the nursing profession in \nall customary ways,’’ id. Whether a par-\nticular requirement is ‘‘essential’’ will, of \ncourse, depend on the facts of the particular \ncase. \n\nIn addition, the public entity may not es-\ntablish requirements for the programs or ac-\ntivities of licensees or certified entities that \nsubject qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability. \nFor example, the public entity must comply \nwith this requirement when establishing \nsafety standards for the operations of licens-\nees. In that case the public entity must en-\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \nnot discriminate against the employment of \nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \nimpermissible manner. \n\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \nthe programs or activities of licensees or \ncertified entities themselves",

In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160. The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504.

Subparagraph (1) \nof new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the \nstandards established by the Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR \npart 1630 will be the applicable compliance \nstandards if the public entity is subject to \ntitle I. If the public entity is not covered by \ntitle I, or until it is covered by title I, sub-\n\nparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 \nstandards for what constitutes employment \ndiscrimination, as established by the Depart-\nment of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards \nfor title I of the ADA and section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act are for the most part \nidentical because title I of the ADA was \nbased on requirements set forth in regula-\ntions implementing section 504. \n\nThe Department, together with the other \nFederal agencies responsible for the enforce-\nment of Federal laws prohibiting employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability, recognizes the potential for jurisdic-\ntional overlap that exists with respect to \ncoverage of public entities and the need to \navoid problems related to overlapping cov-\nerage. The other Federal agencies include \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission, which is the agency primarily re-\nsponsible for enforcement of title I of the \nADA, the Department of Labor, which is the \nagency responsible for enforcement of sec-\ntion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and \n26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal \nfinancial assistance, which are responsible \nfor enforcing section 504 in those programs. \nSection 107 of the ADA requires that coordi-\nnation mechanisms be developed in connec-\ntion with the administrative enforcement of \ncomplaints alleging discrimination under \ntitle I and complaints alleging discrimina-\ntion in employment in violation of the Reha-\nbilitation Act. Although the ADA does not \nspecifically require inclusion of employment \ncomplaints under title II in the coordinating \nmechanisms required by title I, Federal in-\nvestigations of title II employment com-\nplaints will be coordinated on a government-\nwide basis also. The Department is currently \nworking with the EEOC and other affected \nFederal agencies to develop effective coordi-\nnating mechanisms, and final regulations on \nthis issue will be issued on or before January \n26, 1992. \n\nSubpart D—Program Accessibility \n\nSection 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited \n\nSection 35.149 states the general non-\ndiscrimination principle underlying the pro-\ngram accessibility requirements of §§ 35.150 \nand 35.151. \n\nSection 35.150 Existing Facilities \n\nConsistent with section 204(b) of the Act, \nthis regulation adopts the program accessi-\nbility concept found in the section 504 regu-\nlations for federally conducted programs or \nactivities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). The concept \nof ‘‘program accessibility’’ was first used in \nthe section 504 regulation adopted by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare \nfor its federally assisted programs and ac-\ntivities in 1977. It allowed recipients to make \n\n200 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\ntheir federally assisted programs and activi-\nties available to individuals with disabilities \nwithout extensive retrofitting of their exist-\ning buildings and facilities, by offering those \nprograms through alternative methods. Pro-\ngram accessibility has proven to be a useful \napproach and was adopted in the regulations \nissued for programs and activities conducted \nby Federal Executive agencies. The Act pro-\nvides that the concept of program access will \ncontinue to apply with respect to facilities \nnow in existence, because the cost of retro-\nfitting existing facilities is often prohibitive. \n\nSection 35.150 requires that each service, \nprogram, or activity conducted by a public \nentity, when viewed in its entirety, be read-\nily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities",

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id.

In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio. In providing \\nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \\nthe requirements for effective communica-\\ntion in \\u00a7 35.160. The preamble to that section \\ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\\ndures \\n\\nConsistent with \\u00a7 35.105, self-evaluation, \\nthe final rule requires that public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504. In addition, \\u00a7 35.130 \\nincludes a number of provisions derived from \\ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\\ntions implementing section 504\"}}]}",

                "content": "Methods of providing \nthis information include, for example, the \npublication of information in handbooks, \nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \nto the public to describe a public entity’s \nprograms and activities; the display of in-\nformative posters in service centers and \nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\nmation by television or radio. In providing \nthe notice, a public entity must comply with \nthe requirements for effective communica-\ntion in § 35.160. The preamble to that section \ngives guidance on how to effectively commu-\nnicate with individuals with disabilities. \n\nSection 35.107 Designation of Responsible Em-\nployee and Adoption of Grievance Proce-\ndures \n\nConsistent with § 35.105, self-evaluation, \nthe final rule requires that public entities \nwith 50 or more employees designate a re-\nsponsible employee and adopt grievance pro-\ncedures. Most of the commenters who sug-\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \npersons made a similar suggestion con-\ncerning § 35.107. Commenters recommended \neither that all public entities be subject to \n§ 35.107, or that ‘‘50 or more persons’’ be \nchanged to ‘‘15 or more persons.’’ As ex-\nplained in the discussion of § 35.105, the De-\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \n\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \nto carry out responsibilities under this part \nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\nformation about how to locate that em-\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\ning with large agencies are able to easily \nfind a responsible person who is familiar \n\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \npart and can communicate those require-\nments to other individuals in the agency who \nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\ntity’s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\nployees comply with the requirements of this \npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \nby the designated employee. \n\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \nare found in the section 504 regulations for \nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \nof the Department that public entities sub-\nject to this part should be required to estab-\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\nplaints at the local level without requiring \nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \nrequired to exhaust the public entity’s griev-\nance procedures before filing a complaint \nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \nof the remedies available under the griev-\nance procedure would generally be consid-\nered good cause for extending the time al-\nlowed for filing under § 35.170(b). \n\nSubpart B—General Requirements \n\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \nDiscrimination \n\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\nready familiar to State and local entities \ncovered by section 504. In addition, § 35.130 \nincludes a number of provisions derived from \ntitle III of the Act that are implicit to a cer-\ntain degree in the requirements of regula-\ntions implementing section 504",

                "content": "In the proposed regulation the Department \ncross-referenced the regulations imple-\nmenting title I of the ADA, issued by the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission \nat 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance standard \nfor § 35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of \ncoverage and effective date of coverage \nunder title II would have been coextensive \nwith title I. In the final regulation this lan-\nguage is modified slightly. Subparagraph (1) \nof new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the \nstandards established by the Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR \npart 1630 will be the applicable compliance \nstandards if the public entity is subject to \ntitle I. If the public entity is not covered by \ntitle I, or until it is covered by title I, sub-\n\nparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 \nstandards for what constitutes employment \ndiscrimination, as established by the Depart-\nment of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards \nfor title I of the ADA and section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act are for the most part \nidentical because title I of the ADA was \nbased on requirements set forth in regula-\ntions implementing section 504. \n\nThe Department, together with the other \nFederal agencies responsible for the enforce-\nment of Federal laws prohibiting employ-\nment discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability, recognizes the potential for jurisdic-\ntional overlap that exists with respect to \ncoverage of public entities and the need to \navoid problems related to overlapping cov-\nerage. The other Federal agencies include \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission, which is the agency primarily re-\nsponsible for enforcement of title I of the \nADA, the Department of Labor, which is the \nagency responsible for enforcement of sec-\ntion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and \n26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal \nfinancial assistance, which are responsible \nfor enforcing section 504 in those programs. \nSection 107 of the ADA requires that coordi-\nnation mechanisms be developed in connec-\ntion with the administrative enforcement of \ncomplaints alleging discrimination under \ntitle I and complaints alleging discrimina-\ntion in employment in violation of the Reha-\nbilitation Act. Although the ADA does not \nspecifically require inclusion of employment \ncomplaints under title II in the coordinating \nmechanisms required by title I, Federal in-\nvestigations of title II employment com-\nplaints will be coordinated on a government-\nwide basis also. The Department is currently \nworking with the EEOC and other affected \nFederal agencies to develop effective coordi-\nnating mechanisms, and final regulations on \nthis issue will be issued on or before January \n26, 1992. \n\nSubpart D—Program Accessibility \n\nSection 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited \n\nSection 35.149 states the general non-\ndiscrimination principle underlying the pro-\ngram accessibility requirements of §§ 35.150 \nand 35.151. \n\nSection 35.150 Existing Facilities \n\nConsistent with section 204(b) of the Act, \nthis regulation adopts the program accessi-\nbility concept found in the section 504 regu-\nlations for federally conducted programs or \nactivities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). The concept \nof ‘‘program accessibility’’ was first used in \nthe section 504 regulation adopted by the De-\npartment of Health, Education, and Welfare \nfor its federally assisted programs and ac-\ntivities in 1977. It allowed recipients to make \n\n200 - 1991 Section-by-Section Analysis Department of Justice \n\n28 CFR Part 35 \n\ntheir federally assisted programs and activi-\nties available to individuals with disabilities \nwithout extensive retrofitting of their exist-\ning buildings and facilities, by offering those \nprograms through alternative methods. Pro-\ngram accessibility has proven to be a useful \napproach and was adopted in the regulations \nissued for programs and activities conducted \nby Federal Executive agencies. The Act pro-\nvides that the concept of program access will \ncontinue to apply with respect to facilities \nnow in existence, because the cost of retro-\nfitting existing facilities is often prohibitive. \n\nSection 35.150 requires that each service, \nprogram, or activity conducted by a public \nentity, when viewed in its entirety, be read-\nily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities",

      "output": "Age discrimination is a significant concern in the workplace, and it's crucial for employers to understand the legal protections in place to prevent such discrimination. In the United States, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older [doc0]. This means that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants based on their age in hiring, firing, promotions, or any other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees, including state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and the federal government. It is important for employers to be aware of the specific provisions of the ADEA to ensure compliance with the law [doc1]. Additionally, it's essential for employers to create a work environment that promotes inclusivity and prevents age discrimination through policies, training, and a clear grievance procedure for addressing any age discrimination complaints.\n\nEmployers should also be mindful of the need for effective communication with individuals of all ages, as outlined in the ADEA and related regulations. This includes providing clear information about employment opportunities, benefits, and other relevant aspects of the workplace in a manner that is accessible to all employees, regardless of age [doc1].\n\nBy understanding and adhering to the legal protections provided by the ADEA, employers can create a fair and inclusive work environment that respects the rights of employees of all age groups [doc0].",

Most of the commenters who sug-\\ngested that the requirement that self-evalua-\\ntion be maintained on file for three years not \\nbe limited to those employing 50 or more \\npersons made a similar suggestion con-\\ncerning \\u00a7 35.107. Commenters recommended \\neither that all public entities be subject to \\n\\u00a7 35.107, or that \\u2018\\u201850 or more persons\\u2019\\u2019 be \\nchanged to \\u2018\\u201815 or more persons.\\u2019\\u2019 As ex-\\nplained in the discussion of \\u00a7 35.105, the De-\\npartment has not adopted this suggestion. \\n\\nThe requirement for designation of an em-\\nployee responsible for coordination of efforts \\nto carry out responsibilities under this part \\nis derived from the HEW regulation imple-\\nmenting section 504 in federally assisted pro-\\ngrams. The requirement for designation of a \\nparticular employee and dissemination of in-\\nformation about how to locate that em-\\nployee helps to ensure that individuals deal-\\ning with large agencies are able to easily \\nfind a responsible person who is familiar \\n\\nwith the requirements of the Act and this \\npart and can communicate those require-\\nments to other individuals in the agency who \\nmay be unaware of their responsibilities. \\nThis paragraph in no way limits a public en-\\ntity\\u2019s obligation to ensure that all of its em-\\nployees comply with the requirements of this \\npart, but it ensures that any failure by indi-\\nvidual employees can be promptly corrected \\nby the designated employee. \\n\\nSection 35.107(b) requires public entities \\nwith 50 or more employees to establish griev-\\nance procedures for resolving complaints of \\nviolations of this part. Similar requirements \\nare found in the section 504 regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR \\n84.7(b)). The rule, like the regulations for \\nfederally assisted programs, provides for in-\\nvestigation and resolution of complaints by \\na Federal enforcement agency. It is the view \\nof the Department that public entities sub-\\nject to this part should be required to estab-\\nlish a mechanism for resolution of com-\\nplaints at the local level without requiring \\nthe complainant to resort to the Federal \\ncomplaint procedures established under sub-\\npart F. Complainants would not, however, be \\nrequired to exhaust the public entity\\u2019s griev-\\nance procedures before filing a complaint \\nunder subpart F. Delay in filing the com-\\nplaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit \\nof the remedies available under the griev-\\nance procedure would generally be consid-\\nered good cause for extending the time al-\\nlowed for filing under \\u00a7 35.170(b). \\n\\nSubpart B\\u2014General Requirements \\n\\nSection 35.130 General Prohibitions Against \\nDiscrimination \\n\\nThe general prohibitions against discrimi-\\nnation in the rule are generally based on the \\nprohibitions in existing regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504 and, therefore, are al-\\nready familiar to State and local entities \\ncovered by section 504.

This \\nstandard is consistent with the interpreta-\\ntion of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 \\n(1985). The Court in Choate explained that \\nmembers of Congress made numerous state-\\nments during passage of section 504 regard-\\ning eliminating architectural barriers, pro-\\nviding access to transportation, and elimi-\\nnating discriminatory effects of job quali-\\nfication procedures. The Court then noted: \\n\\u2018\\u2018These statements would ring hollow if the \\nresulting legislation could not rectify the \\nharms resulting from action that discrimi-\\nnated by effect as well as by design.\\u2019\\u2019 Id. at \\n297 (footnote omitted). \\n\\nParagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the \\nprohibition enunciated in \\u00a7 35.130(b)(3) to the \\nprocess of selecting sites for construction of \\nnew facilities or selecting existing facilities \\nto be used by the public entity. Paragraph \\n(b)(4) does not apply to construction of addi-\\ntional buildings at an existing site. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(5) prohibits the public enti-\\nty, in the selection of procurement contrac-\\ntors, from using criteria that subject quali-\\nfied individuals with disabilities to discrimi-\\nnation on the basis of disability. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity \\nfrom discriminating against qualified indi-\\nviduals with disabilities on the basis of dis-\\nability in the granting of licenses or certifi-\\ncation. A person is a \\u2018\\u2018qualified individual \\nwith a disability\\u2019\\u2019 with respect to licensing \\nor certification if he or she can meet the es-\\nsential eligibility requirements for receiving \\nthe license or certification (see \\u00a7 35.104). \\n\\nA number of commenters were troubled by \\nthe phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligibility require-\\nments\\u2019\\u2019 as applied to State licensing require-\\nments, especially those for health care pro-\\nfessions. Because of the variety of types of \\nprograms to which the definition of \\u2018\\u2018quali-\\nfied individual with a disability\\u2019\\u2019 applies, it \\nis not possible to use more specific language \\nin the definition. The phrase \\u2018\\u2018essential eligi-\\nbility requirements,\\u2019\\u2019 however, is taken from \\nthe definitions in the regulations imple-\\nmenting section 504, so caselaw under sec-\\ntion 504 will be applicable to its interpreta-\\ntion. In Southeastern Community College v. \\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, for example, the Supreme \\nCourt held that section 504 does not require \\nan institution to \\u2018\\u2018lower or effect substantial \\nmodifications of standards to accommodate \\na handicapped person,\\u2019\\u2019 442 U.S. at 413, and \\nthat the school had established that the \\nplaintiff was not \\u2018\\u2018qualified\\u2019\\u2019 because she was \\nnot able to \\u2018\\u2018serve the nursing profession in \\nall customary ways,\\u2019\\u2019 id.

In that case the public entity must en-\\nsure that standards that it promulgates do \\nnot discriminate against the employment of \\nqualified individuals with disabilities in an \\nimpermissible manner. \\n\\nParagraph (b)(6) does not extend the re-\\nquirements of the Act or this part directly to \\nthe programs or activities of licensees or \\ncertified entities themselves\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"NOTICE:\", \"content\": \"Methods of providing \\nthis information include, for example, the \\npublication of information in handbooks, \\nmanuals, and pamphlets that are distributed \\nto the public to describe a public entity\\u2019s \\nprograms and activities; the display of in-\\nformative posters in service centers and \\nother public places; or the broadcast of infor-\\nmation by television or radio.

This means that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants based on their age in hiring, firing, promotions, or any other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees, including state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and the federal government. It is important for employers to be aware of the specific provisions of the ADEA to ensure compliance with the law [doc1]. Additionally, it's essential for employers to create a work environment that promotes inclusivity and prevents age discrimination through policies, training, and a clear grievance procedure for addressing any age discrimination complaints.\n\nEmployers should also be mindful of the need for effective communication with individuals of all ages, as outlined in the ADEA and related regulations. This includes providing clear information about employment opportunities, benefits, and other relevant aspects of the workplace in a manner that is accessible to all employees, regardless of age [doc1].\n\nBy understanding and adhering to the legal protections provided by the ADEA, employers can create a fair and inclusive work environment that respects the rights of employees of all age groups [doc0]."
